- Pixel snap
- Manage input key states 

## **LOG** ##
-------------
- **[05-09-2021]**
	- Implement a Render API to allow for the end user to draw. Rendere will handle pre-draw, and post-draw. Something simple like DrawQuad.
	- Implement a wrapper around zalgebra's vec3 and vec2
	- Replace all instances of using zalgebra's Vectors and move them over to wrapper Vectors.
	- Moving any uses of za's matrices to dross's wrapper matrix in camera/renderer
	- Input Wrapper
	- Orthographic Camera movements
	- Camera zoom
- **[05-08-2021]**
	- Figure out a way to handle lifetime events.
	- Add a render event for the user to implement
	- Wrapper for zalgebra Matrix4
- **[05-07-2021]**
    - Implement basic Camera
    - Updated camera_2d.zig's documentation
	- Create abstraction over zalgebra's mat4 via transform.zig 
- **[05-06-2021]**
    - Added zalgebra as an dependency for linear algebra
    - Implmented a basic delta time
    - Updated documentation from the texture files from yesterday.
    - Update documentation to remove the parametes and return type
        - New format being description and comments.
            - **Description:** What could this mean?
            - **Comments:** Any noteworthy additions, such as memory ownership (if the method/function is passed an allocator), internal use only, etc.
    - Update comments to remove opengl function signatures and consolidate them in zig_gl_conversions.md
    - Log the conversion methods between OpenGL and Zig in zig_gl_conversions.md
- **[05-05-2021]**
    - Add a use helper method to the shader program
    - Add uniform helper methods to the shader program struct
    - import stb_images.h
    - Remove target_api parameter for buildTexture
    - OpenGL Textures
- **[05-04-2021]**
    - Move most of application build code to build method in app
    - Add shader type to shader compilation failure error message
    - Add color inputs to the shaders
    - Automatically read a shader file and input it to a something.
    - Updated README
- **[05-03-2021]**
    - Render a triangle
    - ShaderProgram
    - Vertex Array Object
    - Vertex Buffer Object
    - Implement index buffer
    - Process Input
    - Document ownership on any functions/methods that are passed an allocator
    - Documented and Commented on all new code from today.
- **[05-02-2021]**
    - Imported OpenGL
    - Laid out Application structure
    - Abstracted OpenGL out from the user's end(main.zig in this case)
    - Learned about Memory Allocators
    - Make Renderer MOSTLY graphics api agnostic
    - Go back through all of the TODOs and begin to document the project
    - Helper methods/functions for the Color struct
    - Replace any instances of r, g, b values with the Color struct
- **[05-01-2021]**
    - Setup Repo
    - Setup VSCode
    - Setup up GLFW
