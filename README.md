# **dross-zig** 
_**dross-zig**_ is a bare bones game framework written in :zap:[Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig):zap:, and created as a means of learning game framework architecture in a zig environment.

## **Disclaimer** 
I do **_not_** recommend using this framework as its existence has been purely for educational purposes. The code that you see is poorly optimized and completely novice.
