# **dross-zig** 
_**dross-zig**_ is a bare bones game framework written in :zap:[Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig):zap:, and created as a means of learning game framework architecture in a zig environment.

## Dependencies
**Zig**:
- [zalgebra](https://github.com/kooparse/zalgebra)

**C/C++ libraries**:
- GLFW (Window and input)
- OpenGL (Graphics API)
- GLAD (OpenGL helper)
- stb_image (Industry tested image loader)

## **Disclaimer** 
I do **_not_** recommend using this framework as its existence has been purely for educational purposes. The code that you see is poorly optimized and completely novice.
